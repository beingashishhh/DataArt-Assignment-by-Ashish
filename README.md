# DataArt Assignment by Ashish

This .NET project was created as part of the **.NET School by DataArt program**.  
It represents my learning journey, where I practice building projects, improving coding skills, and applying concepts learned during the course.

## ðŸ“Œ Homework 1: Project Setup & First API

### What was done
- Set up a **3-layer architecture**:
  - `MyProject.API` â†’ Controllers, Swagger UI
  - `MyProject.Data` â†’ EF Core, DbContext, Migrations
  - `MyProject.Domain` â†’ Entities (e.g., Product)
- Created **DbContext** (`AppDbContext`)
- Created **Entity** (`Product`)
- Configured **SQL Server connection**
- Added **API Controller** for Products
- Implemented **CRUD endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/products` â†’ List all products
  - `GET /api/products/{id}` â†’ Get product by ID
  - `POST /api/products` â†’ Add product
  - `PUT /api/products/{id}` â†’ Update product
  - `DELETE /api/products/{id}` â†’ Delete product
- Tested endpoints using **Swagger UI**

### How to run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beingashishhh/DataArt-Assignment-by-Ashish.git

## ðŸ“Œ Homework 2: API Style, Contracts & Controllers

### âœ… Step 1: Compare API Styles
We evaluated **gRPC, GraphQL, and REST** for the AICalendar system.  

| Criteria               | REST                          | GraphQL                           | gRPC                            |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Simplicity              | Easy to learn, CRUD friendly   | Flexible queries but learning curve | Complex setup, not browser-native |
| Tooling                 | Swagger/OpenAPI widely supported | Apollo/Relay ecosystem strong      | Protobuf + gRPC tooling          |
| Latency/Payload         | Can over/under fetch           | Precise data fetching               | Efficient, binary transport      |
| Client Support          | Works everywhere (web, mobile) | JS/TS support good                  | Strong but limited browser support |
| Security                | Mature standards (JWT/OAuth2)  | Field-level auth possible           | TLS + certs                      |
| Observability           | Easy logging/monitoring        | Needs extra setup                   | Built-in tracing                 |
| Best Fit for AICalendar | âœ… CRUD-friendly, simple rollout | Could work but overkill             | Not needed yet                   |

**Decision â†’** We chose **REST API** because itâ€™s simple, widely supported, and fits CRUD operations for calendars/events.

## Homework 2 (Progress)

###  Chosen API Style
- We are using **REST API** with controllers (`EventsController`, `CalendarsController`, `AttendeesController`).
- REST was chosen because itâ€™s simple, widely supported, and fits CRUD operations for calendars/events.

###  API Contract Overview
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/Events` â†’ List all events
  - `GET /api/Events/{id}` â†’ Get event by ID
  - `POST /api/Events` â†’ Create a new event
  - `PUT /api/Events/{id}` â†’ Update an event
  - `DELETE /api/Events/{id}` â†’ Delete an event
  - (similar endpoints exist for `/api/Calendars` and `/api/Attendees`)

###  Example API Calls
```bash
# Get all events
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/Events

# Create an event
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/Events \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"title":"Team Meeting","description":"Discuss project","start":"2025-09-12T10:00:00Z","end":"2025-09-12T11:00:00Z","timezone":"UTC","calendarId":1}'
```
###  Versioning & Deprecation
- Current version: **v1** (all endpoints under `/api/`)
- Breaking changes will be released as `/api/v2/`
- Deprecated endpoints will remain active for one release cycle with warnings

---

###  Migration Notes for Clients
- Clients using Homework 1 endpoints should migrate to REST controllers
- All requests must now include a valid **JWT token** in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

---

###  Local Development Setup
1. Clone this repository  
2. Run `dotnet restore`  
3. Run `dotnet build`  
4. Start the API with:  
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project MyProject.API
5. Open Swagger UI at â†’ [https://localhost:7127/swagger](https://localhost:7127/swagger)

---

###  Security,  Performance &  Observability
- **Security**: JWT authentication enforced for all protected endpoints  
- **Performance**: REST endpoints optimized for CRUD, lightweight payloads  
- **Observability**: Structured logging enabled with ASP.NET Core logging  

---

###  Known Limitations
- No rate limiting yet (clients can send unlimited requests)  
- Pagination missing for list endpoints (large datasets may be slow to load)  
- Error handling is basic (we only return simple error codes for now)  
- Contract file (`openapi.yaml`) not yet finalized â€” endpoints are documented here in README
